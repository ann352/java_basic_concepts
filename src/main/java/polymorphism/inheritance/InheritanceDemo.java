package polymorphism.inheritance;

public class InheritanceDemo {
    //1) extends -> by this key word we inherit fields and methods from parent
    //2) override -> with that annotation we can override method inhertied from parent - additionally, in the child class we can use the parent method code using the word super

    //      public void sayHey(){
    //      super.sayHey();
    //      System.out.println("My second name is " + this.secondName);
    //    }

    //overload -> that means using the same method name with different sets of parameters

    //Constructors
    //classes inherit nonprivate fields and methods from ancestors but no constructors
    //we have to create own constructors in child class, exmple:
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }

}
